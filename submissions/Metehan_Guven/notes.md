# Investigation Notes

## Tools Used
- **SIEM:** Splunk Enterprise (Mac)
- **Analysis:** Manual log correlation and Splunk queries
- **Diagrams:** Draw.io
- **Video:** Loom screen recording
- **Report:** Microsoft Word → PDF

## Time Spent
- Log analysis and Splunk queries: 4 hours
- Architecture design: 2 hours
- Report writing and formatting: 3 hours
- Video recording and editing: 2 hours
- **Total:** ~11 hours

## Methodology
1. Data validation across four log sources (API, Email, WAF, Web)
2. Temporal analysis to identify attack windows and patterns
3. Cross-source correlation using IP addresses and timestamps
4. Attack pattern recognition and MITRE ATT&CK mapping
5. Timeline reconstruction with chronological ordering
6. Root cause analysis (documented API vulnerability)
7. Architecture review and security gap
